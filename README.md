# Drone Design Project

## Overview
The design of the drone was inspired by DJI's Phantom. This project involves using CAD software for modeling and assembly, along with components sourced from [TraceParts](https://www.traceparts.com/). The workflow includes designing key parts, importing models, and machining them to create the final assembly.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Modeling with Rhinoceros
In the initial phase, [Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/) software was used to model the following components:

- **Lower Shell**: Realized as a foundational part of the drone.
- **Upper Shell**: Designed to couple with the lower shell.
- **Propeller Model**: Created for aerodynamic performance.

### Phase 2: Importing and Machining in SolidEdge
The models from [Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/) were imported into [SolidEdge](https://solidedge.siemens.com/) for further machining and assembly.

#### **Upper Shell**:
- Hollowed out for weight optimization.
- Lip modeled for coupling with the lower shell.
- Holes created for housing the propeller shaft and screws.

#### **Lower Shell**:
- Hollowed out to accommodate internal components.
- Bases created for brushless motors.

### Phase 3: Brushless Motor Assembly
The brushless motor assembly was created using [SolidEdge](https://solidedge.siemens.com/):

- Bearings inserted into the motor.
- Motor shaft modeled.
- Propeller coupling achieved using a key mechanism.
